  <h1>SERVERS</h1>
  <p>Public, Private, and Hybrid clouds are all ways for a company to access information over servers. They each have their own advantages and downsides, and which a company chooses to use will depend on how its business functions.</p> 
 </div>
<div class="row1">
 <h1>PUBLIC</h1>
 <p> When you use a public cloud, you can share access to the server that you’re hosting with other people. That means everyone can share documents, files, and pretty much everything, making it the most efficient for a collaboration. It can also be useful when sharing information with your customers or tenants.</p>
</div>
<div class="row2">
 <h1>PRIVATE</h1>
 <p>When using a private cloud, no one but members of your company can access your server. So, all of your files are safe and sound within the walls of the Cloud. Another plus is that you can customize everything to fit your personal needs!</p>
</div>
<div class="row3">
 <h1>HYBRID</h1>
 <p>A hybrid cloud is, essentially, a mixture of public and private. You get the perks or both public and private, plus more! For example, you can create new, cutting-edge apps with no limitations. As the name hybrid suggests, you can then use those apps on your private cloud, which can the n be used on  the public portion when the need arises!</p>
