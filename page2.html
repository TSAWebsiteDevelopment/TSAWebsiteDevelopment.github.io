<div class="introparagraph">
 <p>Cloud computing may seem like something pretty complicated to those who are not yet familiar with it. And, yes, some aspects could quite understandably be called complicated. Cloud computing is, in a nutshell, information that can be accessed over your computer`s hard drive. The internet is just another name for the cloud. When you search on Google, FireFox, or Internet Explorer, you are accessing all the information that is on the cloud. In other words, when you search on the internet, you are cloud computing. In more specific terms, cloud computing can be broken down into three categories. Those categories each have their own level of customization and user flexibility. The three services, in order of least to greatest customization, are SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.</p>

 <div class="column1">
  <h1>SAAS</h1>
  <p>Now we are going more in-depth to each of the three categories. SaaS - or Software as a Service - is the first that we will discuss. It is the least customizable of all the services, but it is still very important in everyday life, and a more-than-efficient service. You most likely use this service roughly every day; at work, home, or school. SaaS lets you run existing online applications. For example, you are using SaaS when you open Study Island to study; Google Docs or Microsoft Word to write an essay, WeVideo to edit videos, and so on. With Saas, you can access the same information on any computer, and everything is either free or paid via subscription. One of the only downsides to SaaS is that the more generic applications do not always suit your specific needs, especially in a business environment.</p>

<div class="column2">
 <h1>PAAS</h1>
 <p>The next service is PaaS, or Platforms as a Service. Paas provides a platform (hence the name) or environment and tools to create your own online application. For example, Google has an application literally called Google App Engine, that enables people to develop and run their own applications. Some of the positive aspects to Paas are that you can develop programs rapidly at a fairly low cost, and you can deploy it in a public or private environment. The downside to this is that you are limited to the provider`s specific languages and building blocks that they give you to create your application. In addition, there is a chance of a vendor lock-out. In other words, sometimes the application cannot be transferred from one provider`s platform to another.</p>
</div>
<div class="column3">
 <h1>IAAS</h1>
 <p>The last of these three services that we will talk about is IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service. IaaS allows people to run existing applications on the cloud supplier`s hardware. This means that applications can be transferred from the company`s data center to the IaaS provider in order to reduce IT (Information Technology) coats for the company.</p>
