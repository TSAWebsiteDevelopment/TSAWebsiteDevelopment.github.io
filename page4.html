  <h1>THE PROS AND CONS</h1>
  <p>Cloud computing is indefinitely, now, part of almost everyone’s daily lives. Need resources to write an essay, online? Feel like emailing a friend for lunch? Want to communicate with a client to inform them about your product? Typing some notes on Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or Dropbox Paper? Need to present your work and progress for your boss on Google Slides, Powerpoint, Prezi, or Custom Show? Want to store data from your company’s recent sales and restocked supplies online? Then you’re using cloud computing. Even data from a simple Google search will be stored in the cloud. But for a thorough understanding of what cloud computing really is, you’ll need to know both the outstanding features and the more negative downsides to it. After all, to fully comprehend a subject, you need to see all the sides.  </p>

 <div class="prosparagraph">
  <h1>PROS</h1>
  <p> Many people in the business industry, from major corporations to smaller are adapting to this new technology.  There are a ton of reasons why people are converting, so to make this clearer, I’ve bulleted some examples below. </p>
  <h5>Instant Deployment</h5>
   <li>Once you make the switch to cloud computing, you’ll have full access to every aspect within minutes. Talk about efficiency!</li>
  <h5>Cost Efficeincy</h5>
   <li>Companies who use the actual software have a lot more work to do in terms of maintenance. Cloud computing is generally more affordable, and I can guarantee that it’ll seem cheap compared to all of the upkeep of your tech without it. In addition, there are one-time payment (along with many other scalable payment choices) options for cloud computing so that you’re hassle-free throughout your career!</li>
  <h5>Practically Unlimited Storage</h5>
   <li>Have you ever maxed out the storage on your smartphone? Annoying, isn’t it? When you store information in the cloud, it gives you almost unlimited storage capacity. SO, no more worrying about having to purchase more storage!</li>
 </div>
 <div class="consparagraph">
  <h1>CONS</h1>
  <p>While cloud computing has many advantages, it may also cause much harm to you or your company if not understood or used properly.</P>
  <h5>Security Issues</h5>
   <li>Storing information in the cloud could make  your company vulnerable to external hacks. (An external hack is when someone, on a different computer, illegally accesses you or your company’s files.) Although, nothing on the Internet is completely secure from being hacked.</li>
  <h5>Technical Issues</h5>
   <li>Cloud computing is extremely prone to many technical dysfunctions, like an outage. (An outage is a period of time when cloud service is unavailable.) *  In addition, a very good internet connection is required for the server to run smoothly. If network or connection issues occur, you’ll definitely encounter problems.</li>
  <h5>P.S.</h5>
   <li>Although, there are many ways in which a company can prevent these effects. Under ‘Resources,” There’s a link included that explains the correct prevention procedure. Yet, even those who keep very high standards of maintenance will sometimes run into trouble.</li>
 </div>
 <div class="outroparagraph">
  <h5>TO CONLUDE...</h5>
   <p>Everything has its ups and downs, and this certainly implies to cloud computing. While it looks like it has way more pros than cons, it all depends on your point of view.</p>
